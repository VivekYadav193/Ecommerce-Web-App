# Ecommerce-Web-App

My personal Ecommerce Web App project is a self-contained, 
educational endeavor designed to gain hands-on experience in web development 
and e-commerce systems. It is a simplified representation of an e-commerce platform, 
developed for learning and experimentation purposes. The project aims to demonstrate 
key e-commerce functionalities without the intention of real-world deployment. 
It serves as a practice ground for web development skills and a creative 
exploration of online shopping concepts.
